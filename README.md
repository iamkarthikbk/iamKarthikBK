### Hi there! <!--ðŸ‘‹-->

My name is Karthik, and I'm an Engineer, Deep Sea Diver and Photographer. I am currently with [InCore](https://www.incoresemi.com) as a CPU Design Engineer/Micro-Architect.
Prior to this, I was with the Centre for Heterogeneous and Intelligent Processing Systems working on Energy Efficient Computing Techniques.
Prior to that, I was a mentee at the Linux Foundation working on device drivers for the Linux kernel.

I have about 3 years of experience with CPU core micro-architecture in the Indian semiconductor industry.
I also have an additional year of research internship experience in energy efficient computing techniques.
My research interests lie in everything that makes compute better. I plan to pursue a PhD some day.

I am a casual student at the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras. I have a bachelor's degree from PES University in Bengaluru, India.

I like to write about things that interest me at work, you can read some of those articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@talktokarthikbk).
I adore travelling and adventure. I am a certified enriched air nitrox diver. I am also a hobbyist photographer.
You can check out some of the best pictures I've clicked on Unsplash :) ( https://unsplash.com/@thatbangaloreanguy )

I am part of a reading group (currently inactive) - [India Systems' Research Discussions](https://systemsresearch.carrd.co/).
