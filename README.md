### Hi there! <!--üëã-->

I am currently working as an RTL Design Engineer at InCore Semiconductors. Prior to this, I was with the Centre for Heterogeneous and Intelligent Processing Systems in Bengaluru, working on Energy Efficient Multi-Core RISC-V Architectures. Prior to that, I was a mentee at the Linux Foundation where I worked with the linux kernel community to fix critical bugs. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from PES University, Bengaluru. I want to pursue a PhD post gaining some experience in the Indian semiconductor industry.
