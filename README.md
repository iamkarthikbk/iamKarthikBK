### Hi there! <!--üëã-->

My name is Karthik, and I'm an Engineer and Photographer, both by passion and profession. I am currently with [InCore](https://www.incoresemi.com) as a CPU Micro-Architect.
Prior to this, I was with the Centre for Heterogeneous and Intelligent Processing Systems working on Energy Efficient Computing Techniques.
Prior to that, I was a mentee at the Linux Foundation working on device drivers for the Linux kernel.

I have about 2 years of experience in CPU micro-architecture in the Indian semiconductor industry.
I also have an additional year of research experience in energy efficient computing techniques.
My research interests lie in CPU micro-architecture for high-performance computing. I plan to pursue a PhD some day.

I have a bachelor's degree from PES University in Bengaluru, India.

I like to write about things that interest me at work, you can read some of those articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@talktokarthikbk).
I love travelling and adventure. I am a certified open-water diver. I am also a photographer.
You can check out some of the best pictures I've clicked on Unsplash :) ( https://unsplash.com/@thatbangaloreanguy ) ‚ù§

I am part of a reading group (currently inactive) - [India Systems' Research Discussions](https://systemsresearch.carrd.co/).
