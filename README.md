### Hi there! <!--üëã-->

I am currently with InCore Semiconductors as an RTL Design Engineer. Prior to this, I was with the Centre for Heterogeneous and Intelligent Computing working on Energy Efficient Computing Techniques. Prior to that, I was a mentee at the Linux Foundation.

I have about a year of research experience and close to another 1.5 years of industry experience. My research interests lie in microarchitecture for high-performance and secure computing.

I am also a photographer. You can check out my work on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@thatbangaloreanguy) :)
